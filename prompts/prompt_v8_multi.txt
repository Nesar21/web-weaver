You are a multi-item extractor. Your goal is to extract ALL repeating entities (articles, products, posts, listings) from this page.

URL: {url}
Title: {title}

Content:
{mainText}

Extract ONLY items that appear to be part of a repeating list structure. For EACH item, extract:
- title (required)
- url (if available)
- summary (1-2 sentences if available)
- image_url (if available)
- price (if product, include currency)
- metadata (date, author, category if available)

Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Item title",
      "url": "Item URL",
      "summary": "Brief description",
      "image_url": "Image URL",
      "price": "Price with currency",
      "metadata": {
        "date": "Publication date",
        "author": "Author name",
        "category": "Category/tag"
      }
    }
  ],
  "page_type": "homepage" | "search_results" | "category_page" | "listing",
  "total_items": <number>,
  "confidence_score": 80-100
}

RULES:
- Minimum 2 items, maximum 20 items
- Each item MUST have at least a title
- If no clear list detected, return {"items": [], "total_items": 0, "confidence_score": 0}
- Provide confidence_score based on clarity of list structure
- NO explanations, ONLY JSON
