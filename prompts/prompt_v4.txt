2. Use contextual clues and surrounding elements to infer missing metadata
3. Return null only when genuinely no relevant information exists
4. Prioritize completeness with accuracy over extreme caution
5. For aggregated content pages (homepages), focus SURGICALLY on the MOST PROMINENT or FIRST article only
6. Cross-reference multiple page elements to validate extracted information
7. Adapt extraction strategy based on detected content type
